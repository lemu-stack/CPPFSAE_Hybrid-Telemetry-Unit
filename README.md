# CPPFSAE_Hybrid-Telemetry-Unit
This repository contains a complete telemetry pipeline designed for Formula SAE applications, developed on the Raspberry Pi 5.

The system reads telemetry data from the CAN bus, processes it on-device, and/or optionally forwards it to a cloud backend for deeper analytics and long-term logging. Real-time data is streamed using MQTT and WebSockets for dashboards, monitoring tools, and development testing. Supports hybrid edge–cloud and MQTT-WebSocket switching based on network conditions
